# JavaFundamentalPractice
I am attempting to self-educate myself in Java, I will be practicing some of the fundamental functions of Java.

Hi, I'm Noe Rivera Jr., I have begun to educate myself on one of the most widely used progamming langauge, Java. My current programming bootcamp, the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy, has a strong focus on C#. After doing some research, in terms of syntax, C# and Java are very similar. In this project, you can see me utilizing some of the key fundamentals of Java.
